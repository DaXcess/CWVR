### Verifying mod signature

CW // VR comes pre-packaged with a digital signature. You can use tools like GPG to verify the `CWVR.dll.sig` signature with the `CWVR.dll` plugin file.

The public key which can be used to verify the file is [9422426F6125277B82CC477DCF78CC72F0FD5EAD (OpenPGP Key Server)](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/9422426F6125277B82CC477DCF78CC72F0FD5EAD).
