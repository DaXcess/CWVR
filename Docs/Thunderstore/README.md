Ready to become SpöökFamous in VR? Well wait no more!

CW // VR _<sup><sub>(Content Warning // VR)</sub></sup>_ is a mod for the game Content Warning that transforms it into a fully fledged 6DOF VR experience.

Just like my Lethal Company VR mod, CW // VR is powered by Unity's OpenXR plugin and is thereby compatible with a wide range of headsets, controllers and runtimes, like Oculus, Virtual Desktop, SteamVR and many more!

CW // VR is also compatible with multiplayer, both in lobbies with other VR players, other Non-VR players and even with other vanilla players (though they can't see hand movements). The host is not required to have the VR mod installed for other VR players in the lobby to see each other's hand movements.

### Open Source

# Configuring the mod

You can change the mod configuration from within the game itself. Just launch the game with the VR mod installed, get to the main menu, go to the settings and press "Mods". In here you can configure the VR mod to your liking.

> _You can change the settings mid-game, you do not have to restart or rejoin._

# Controls

By default, the game only supports Oculus and Index controllers. If you are using any other type of controller, you can change the bindings in the `Controls` settings menu in the game settings.

For a list of default controls, check out the controls [wiki page](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/DaXcess/CWVR/wiki/1966-controls/) on Thunderstore.
