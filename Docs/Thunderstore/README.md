Ready to become SpöökFamous in VR? Well wait no more!

CW // VR _<sup><sub>(Content Warning // VR)</sub></sup>_ is a mod for the game Content Warning that transforms it into a fully fledged 6DOF VR experience.

Just like my Lethal Company VR mod, CW // VR is powered by Unity's OpenXR plugin and is thereby compatible with a wide range of headsets, controllers and runtimes, like Oculus, Virtual Desktop, SteamVR and many more!

CW // VR is also compatible with multiplayer, both in lobbies with other VR players, other Non-VR players and even with other vanilla players (though they can't see hand movements). The host is not required to have the VR mod installed for other VR players in the lobby to see each other's hand movements.

### Open Source

The source code for this mod is available on GitHub! Check it out: [DaXcess/CWVR](https://github.com/DaXcess/CWVR).

### License

This mod is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL-3.0). For mote info check [LICENSE](https://github.com/DaXcess/CWVR/blob/main/LICENSE).

### Verifying mod signature

> If you don't care about this, skip this part.

CW // VR comes pre-packaged with a digital signature. You can use tools like GPG to verify the `CWVR.dll.sig` signature with the `CWVR.dll` plugin file.

The public key which can be used to verify the file is [9422426F6125277B82CC477DCF78CC72F0FD5EAD (OpenPGP Key Server)](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/9422426F6125277B82CC477DCF78CC72F0FD5EAD).

# Configuring the mod

You can change the mod configuration from within the game itself. Just launch the game with the VR mod installed, get to the main menu, go to the settings and press "VR Settings". In here you can configure the VR mod to your liking.

> _You can change the settings mid-game, you do not have to restart or rejoin._

# Controls

At the moment, CW // VR only supports Oculus styled controller layouts (ABXY-based). For more detailed controls, check out the controls [wiki page](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/DaXcess/CWVR/wiki) on Thunderstore.
